## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a nice refresher for getting back into working with HTML and CSS. I could not remember how to center a div horizontally and vertically with flexbox, so I had to relearn that. I was excited to try out CSS nesting for the first time.

### Continued development

For future projects, I need to work on my layout and responsive design skills. For more advanced challenges, I'd like to try using CSS variables to follow the project's design system.

### Useful resources

- [Emmet Documentation](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) - I :heart: shortcuts! This helped me tremendously with writing CSS styles quickly.
- [VS Code Shortcuts (Mac)](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) - More shortcuts. I've been trying to use my mouse less in VS Code for a more efficient workflow.
- [CSS Nesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting) - This MDN article helped me learn how to use CSS nesting and how it is different than Sass nesting.
